# Artificial Intelligence-based diagnosis of asbestosis: analysis of a database with applicants for asbestosis state-aid (European Radiology) :computer:

Noninvasive diagnosis of asbestosis for financial compensation suffers from interobserver variability. We developed/integrated an AI-system of multiple components (lung segmentation, anomaly heatmap, classifier) to reproduce the verdict of a panel of medical experts. 

## 1. Setting up the environment :deciduous_tree:
Create and activate a conda environment with Python
 ```
conda create -n asbestosis python
conda activate asbestosis
 ```
Install the requirements (includes R)
 ```
conda install tensorflow-gpu==1.15
conda install keras==2.3.1
conda install matplotlib==3.2.2
conda install scikit-learn=0.24.1
conda install scipy
pip install pynrrd
 ```

## 2. How to run the code ðŸš€ 
Adjust the folders to your own paths in ``data_generator.py`` and ``train.py``. Moreover, you dont need anomaly heatmap or lung segmentations to run it. Just set 'n_channels' to 1 and load from your orginal CT folder.

``python train.py``

## 3. Troubleshooting ðŸ”¨ 
If you encounter a h5py error:
pip install 'h5py==2.10.0' --force-reinstall
