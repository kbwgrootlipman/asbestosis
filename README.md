# Artificial Intelligence-based diagnosis of asbestosis: analysis of a database with applicants for asbestosis state-aid :computer: :mag_right: 


Managed by Kevin Groot Lipman (k.groot.lipman@nki.nl, k.b.w.grootlipman@gmail.com)

Noninvasive diagnosis of asbestosis for financial compensation suffers from interobserver variability. We developed/integrated an AI-system of multiple components (lung segmentation, anomaly heatmap, classifier) to reproduce the verdict of a panel of medical experts. 

Our paper is accepted at European Radiology, link will follow.

## 1. Setting up the environment :deciduous_tree:
Create and activate a conda environment with Python
 ```
conda create -n asbestosis python=3.7.9
conda activate asbestosis
 ```
Install the requirements
 ```
conda install tensorflow-gpu==1.15
conda install keras==2.3.1
conda install pandas
conda install matplotlib==3.2.2
conda install scikit-learn=0.24.1
conda install scipy
pip install pynrrd
 ```
Follow instructions at https://github.com/keras-team/keras-contrib to install keras_contrib

## 2. How to run the code ðŸš€ 

### 2.1 VAE training.
- Collect a healthy (CT) dataset.
- Adjust the folders to your own paths for this dataset in ``data_generator_vae.py`` and ``train_vae.py``. 

We adopted the model of Rodney et al. -> https://github.com/lalonderodney/SegCaps


You dont need to have anomaly heatmaps or lung segmentations to run it. Just set 'n_channels' in ``train.py`` to 1 and load from your orginal CT folder.

``python train.py``

## 3. Troubleshooting ðŸ”¨ 
If you encounter a h5py error:
pip install 'h5py==2.10.0' --force-reinstall
